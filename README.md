# crypto-devs

A project I built for [HackFS](https://fs.ethglobal.co/) during virtual hackathon between July 30 - August 20, 2021. Here is a [link](https://showcase.ethglobal.co/hackfs2021/crypto-devs-nft) to the hackathon page for this project.

The contract is deployed to Rinkeby testnet at [0xe6ee128af7a212c6b26065d843d7220f0666b0e2](https://rinkeby.etherscan.io/address/0xe6ee128af7a212c6b26065d843d7220f0666b0e2)

You can view the NFT collection on [opensea testnet](https://testnets.opensea.io/collection/crypto-devs)
